# Titanic_EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
## Overview

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for data analysis and machine learning exercises. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

The goal of this EDA is to gain insights into the dataset, understand the variables, and uncover patterns that might inform further analysis or modeling.

## Files

- `Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis. This contains all the preprocessing steps and visualisations.
- `Titanic.csv`: The original Titanic dataset in CSV format.


## Analysis Highlights

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and performed feature engineering where relevant.
- Visualisation: Created visualisations to explore the distribution of variables, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
- Survival Analysis: Investigated factors affecting survival rates, such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.
- Correlation: Explored correlations between variables to identify potential insights.
